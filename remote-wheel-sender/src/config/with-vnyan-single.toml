# This configuration file is set up to read the rotation of the wheel, as well as shift paddle and
# pedal inputs, and inject them directly into VNyan to pose the avatar and/or peripheral props.
#
# A VNyan node graph and props that are intended to work with this configuration can be found at:
# https://github.com/barinzaya/remote-wheel/tree/main/vnyan
#
# There are CHANGEME tags in the configuration below that indicate things you may need to change.
# Upon closing, this configuration will be saved as remote-wheel-sender.toml, and you may edit it
# again at any time.
#
# The configuration is organized into sections, with each section indicated by a section header in
# square brackets. Double square brackets may also be used for section headers of which there can be
# more than one.
#
# All configuration entries (lines of the format key = value) belong to the last section for which
# there was a header. Indentation is optional, but can help make the file more readable.
#
# Any text after a # character, such as this text, is called a comment. Comments are ignored, and do
# not affect the configuration. Comments can be used to add notes, such as these, or to temporarily
# remove values that you may want to add back in later. You may remove any comment without affecting
# the configuration.
